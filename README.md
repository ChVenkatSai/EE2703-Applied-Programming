# EE2703-Applied-Programming
Collection of codes for the Applied programming course at IITM for Jan-May 2020 Semester. 
This repository contains a collection of Python code examples demonstrating the implementation of various concepts covered in the Applied Programming Lab course. Each code example corresponds to a specific topic from the course description:

Applied Programming Lab
* Introduction to Scientific Python * Least Squares * Simulating in time - Tubelight * Simulating a device - Laplace's equation, ampere's law * Using the system module to solve for step and impulse response of op-amp circuits * Using the DFT to obtain steady state response of linear (and op-amp) circuits * Simulating noise in circuits * Low pass filtering of signals using digital filters. Effect on SNR

Please note that these code examples are meant for educational purposes and serve as a reference for understanding the concepts discussed in the Applied Programming Lab course. Feel free to explore, experiment, and modify the code to enhance your learning experience.

For any questions or clarifications related to the code examples, please refer to the course materials or consult with the course instructor.
